# User Database API

1. Creates table of users in RDS
2. Creates API host
3. Creates API client CRUD:
    - C: Implement GET methods to get different entries from different tables using query string parameters
    - R: Implement POST methods to create a new entry
    - U: Implement PUT methods to update an existing entry
    - D: Implement DELETE methods to delete an existing entry by id
    - Be careful what you do with this code if it contains your database

4. Runs API host on EC2
